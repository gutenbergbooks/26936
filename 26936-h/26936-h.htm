<p class="p1">ILLUSTRATOR LLEWELLYN</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I was</span> in the midst of the
fourth draft of my doctorate
thesis when Aunt Matilda's telegram
came. It could not have
come at a worse time. The deadline
for my thesis was four days
away and there was a minimum
of five days of hard work to do
on it yet. I was working around
the clock.</p>

<p>If it had been a telegram informing
me of her death I could
not have taken time out to attend
the funeral. If it had been
a telegram saying she was at
death's door I'm very much
afraid I would have had to call
the hospital and order them to
keep her alive a few days longer.</p>

<p>Instead, it was a tersely
worded appeal. ARTHUR STOP
COME AT ONCE STOP AM IN
TERRIBLE TROUBLE STOP
DO NOT PHONE STOP AUNT
MATILDA.</p>

<p>So there was nothing else for
me to do. I laid the telegram
aside and kept on working on
my thesis. That is not as heartless
as it might seem. I simply
could not imagine Aunt Matilda
in terrible trouble. The end of
the world I could imagine, but
not Aunt Matilda in trouble.</p>

<div class="figr">

<p>She was the classic flat-chested
ageless spinster living alone
in the midst of her dustless
bric-a-brac and Spode in
a frame house of the same vintage
as herself at the edge of
the classic small town of Sumac,
near the southwest corner of
Wisconsin. I had visited her for
two days over a year ago, and
she had looked exactly the same
as she had when I stayed with
her when I was six all summer,
and there was no question but
what she would some day attend
my funeral when I died of old
age, and she would still look the
same as always.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was no conceivable
trouble of terrestrial origin that
could touch her&mdash;or would want
to. And, as it turned out, I was
right in that respect.</p>

<p>I was right in another respect
too. By finishing my thesis I became
a Ph.D. on schedule, and if
I had abandoned all that and
rushed to Sumac the moment I
received the telegram it could
not have materially altered the
outcome of things. And Aunt
Matilda, hanging on the wall of
my study, knitting things for
the Red Cross, will attest to
that.</p>

<p>You, of course, might argue
about her being there. You
might even insist that I am
hanging on her wall instead.
And I would have to agree with
you, since it all depends on the
point of view and as I sit here
typing I can look up and see myself
hanging on her wall.</p>

<p>But perhaps I had better begin
at the beginning when, with
my thesis behind me, I arrived
on the 4:15 milk run, as they
call the train that stops on its
way past Sumac.</p>

<p>I was in a very disturbed
state of mind, as anyone who
has ever turned in a doctorate
thesis can well imagine. For the
life of me I couldn't be sure
whether I had used <i>symbol</i> or
<i>token</i> on line 7, sheet 23, of my
thesis, and it was a bad habit
of mine to unconsciously interchange
them unpredictably, and
I knew that Dr. Walters could
very well vote against acceptance
of my thesis on that ground
alone. Also, I had thought of a
much better opening sentence to
my thesis, and was having to use
will power to keep from rushing
back to the university to ask
permission to change it.</p>

<p>I had practically no sleep during
the fourteen-hour run, and
what sleep I did have had been
interrupted by violent starts of
awaking with a conviction that
this or that error in the initial
draft of my thesis had not been
corrected by the final draft. And
then, of course, I would have to
think the thing through and recall
when I had made the correction,
before I could go back to
sleep.</p>

<p>So I was a wreck, mentally, if
not physically, when I stepped
off the train onto the wooden depot
platform that had certainly
been built in the Pleistocene
Era, with my oxblood two-suiter
firmly clutched in my left hand.</p>

<p>With snorts of steam and the
loud clanking of loose drives,
the train got under way again,
its whistle wailing mournfully
as the last empty coach car sped
past me and retreated into the
distance.</p>

<p>As I stood there, my brain
tingling with weariness, and
listened to the absolute silence
of the town triumph over the
last distant wail of the train
whistle, I became aware that
something about Sumac was
different.</p>

<p>What it was, I didn't know. I
stood where I was a moment
longer, trying to analyze it. In
some indefinable way everything
looked unreal. That was as close
as I could come to it, and of
course having pinned it down
that far I at once dismissed it
as a trick of the mind produced
by tiredness.</p>

<p>I began walking. The planks
of the platform were certainly
real enough. I circled the depot
without going in, and started
walking in the direction of Aunt
Matilda's, which was only a
short eight blocks from the depot,
as I had known since I was
six.</p>

<p>The feeling of the unreality
of my surroundings persisted,
and with it came another feeling,
of an invisible pressure
against me. Almost a resentment.
Not only from the people,
but from the houses and even
the trees.</p>

<hr />

<p>Slowly I began to realize that
it couldn't be entirely my imagination.
Most of the dozen or so
people I passed knew me, and I
remembered suddenly that every
other time I had come to Aunt
Matilda's they had stopped to
talk with me and I had had to
make some excuse to escape
them. Now they were behaving
differently. They would look at
me absently as they might at
any stranger walking from the
direction of the depot, then their
eyes would light up with recognition
and they would open
their lips to greet me with
hearty welcome.</p>

<p>Then, as though they just
thought of something, they
would change, and just say,
"Hello, Arthur," and continue
on past me.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to conclude
that this strange behavior
was probably caused by something
in connection with Aunt
Matilda. Had she perhaps been
named as corespondent in the
divorce of the local minister?
Had she, of all people, had a
child out of wedlock?</p>

<p>Things in a small town can be
deadly serious, so by the time
her familiar frame house came
into view down the street I was
ready to keep a straight face, no
matter what, and reserve my
chuckles for the privacy of her
guest room. It would be a new
experience, to find Aunt Matilda
guilty of any human frailty. It
was slightly impossible, but I
had prepared myself for it.</p>

<p>And that first day her behavior
convinced me I was right
in my conclusion.</p>

<p>She appeared in the doorway
as I came up the front walk. She
was breathing hard, as though
she had been running, and there
was a dust streak on the side of
her thin face.</p>

<p>"Hello, Arthur," she said
when I came up on the porch.
She shook my hand as limply as
always, and gave me a reluctant
duty peck on the cheek, then
backed into the house to give me
room to enter.</p>

<p>I glanced around the familiar
surroundings, waiting for her to
blurt out the cause of her telegram,
and feeling a little guilty
about not having come at once.</p>

<p>I felt the loneliness inside her
more than I ever had before.
There was a terror way back in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"You look tired, Arthur," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, glad of the opportunity
she had given me to
explain. "I had to finish my
thesis and get it in by last night.
Two solid years of hard work
and it had to be done or the
whole thing was for nothing.
That's why I couldn't come four
days ago. And you seemed quite
insistent that I shouldn't call."
I smiled to let her know that I
remembered about party lines in
a small town.</p>

<p>"It's just as well," she said.
And while I was trying to decide
what the antecedent of her
remark was she said, "You can
go back on the morning train."</p>

<p>"You mean the trouble is
over?" I said, relieved.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. But she had
hesitated.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had
ever seen her tell a lie.</p>

<p>"You must be hungry," she
rushed on. "Put your suitcase
in the room and wash up." She
turned her back to me and hurried
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>I was hungry. The memory of
her homey cooking did it. I
glanced around the front room.
Nothing had changed, I thought.
Then I noticed the framed
portrait of my father and his
three brothers was hanging
where the large print of a basket
of fruit used to hang. The
basket of fruit picture was
where the portrait should have
been, and it was entirely too big
a picture for that spot. I would
never have thought Aunt Matilda
could tolerate anything out of
proportion. And the darker area
of wallpaper where the fruit picture
had prevented fading stood
out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>I looked around the room for
other changes. The boat picture
that had hung to the right of
the front door was not there.
On the floor under where it
should have been I caught the
flash of light from a shard of
glass. Next to it, the drape
framing the window was not
hanging right.</p>

<p>On impulse I went over and
peeked behind the drape. There,
leaning against the wall, was
the boat picture with fragments
of splintered glass still in it.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the evidence it appeared
that Aunt Matilda had either
been trying to hang the picture
where it belonged, or taking it
down, and it had slipped out of
her hands and fallen, and she
had hidden it behind the drape
and hastily swept up the broken
glass.</p>

<p>But why? Even granting that
Aunt Matilda might behave in
such an erratic fashion (which
was obvious from the evidence),
I couldn't imagine a sensible
reason.</p>

<p>It occurred to me, facetiously,
that she might have gone in for
pictures of musclemen, and, seeing
me coming up the street, she
had rushed them into hiding and
brought out the old pictures.</p>

<p>That could account for the
evidence&mdash;except for one thing.
I hadn't dallied. She could not
possibly have seen me earlier
than sixty seconds before I came
up the front walk.</p>

<p>Still, the telegrapher at the
depot could have called her and
told her I was here when he saw
me get off the train.</p>

<p>I shrugged the matter off and
went to the guest room. It too
was the same as always, except
for one thing. A picture.</p>

<p>It was a color photograph of
the church, taken from the
street. The picture was in a
frame, but without glass over it,
and was about eighteen inches
wide and thirty high.</p>

<p>It was a very good picture.
Very lifelike. There was a car
parked at the curb in front of
the church, and someone inside
the car smoking a cigarette, and
it was so real I would have
sworn I could see the streamer
of smoke rising from the cigarette
moving.</p>

<p>The odor of good food came
from the kitchen, reminding me
to get busy. I opened my two-suiter
and took out my toilet kit
and went to the bathroom.</p>

<p>I shaved, brushed my teeth,
and combed my hair. Afterward
I popped into my room just for
a second to put my toilet kit on
the dresser, and hurried to the
dining room.</p>

<p>Something nagged at the back
of my mind all the time I was
eating. After dinner Aunt Matilda
suggested I'd better get
some sleep. I couldn't argue. I
was already asleep on my feet.
Her fried chicken and creamed
gravy and mashed potatoes had
been an opiate.</p>

<p>I didn't even bother to hang
up my clothes. I slipped into the
heaven of comfort of the bed
and closed my eyes. And the
next minute it was morning.</p>

<p>Getting out of bed, I stopped
in mid motion. The picture of
the church was no longer on the
wall. And as I stared at the
blank spot where it had been,
the thing that had nagged me
during dinner last night finally
leaped into consciousness.</p>

<p>When I had dashed into the
room and out again last night
on the way to the dining room
I had glanced briefly at the picture
and something had been
different about it. Now I knew
what had been different.</p>

<p>The car had no longer been in
front of the church.</p>

<hr />

<p>I lit a cigarette and sat on the
edge of the bed. I thought about
that picture, and simply could
not bring myself to believe the
accuracy of that fleeting impression.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda had slipped
into my room and removed the
picture while I slept. That was
obvious. Why had she done
that? The fleeting impression
that I couldn't be positive about
would give her a sensible
reason.</p>

<p>I studied my memory of that
picture as I had closely studied
it. It had been a remarkable picture.
The more I recalled its
details the more remarkable it
became. I couldn't remember any
surface gloss or graining to it,
but of course I had not been
looking for such things. Only an
expert photographer would notice
or recognize such technical
details.</p>

<p>My thoughts turned in the
direction of Aunt Matilda&mdash;and
her telegram. Her source of income,
I knew, was her part of
the estate of my grandfather,
and amounted to something like
thirty thousand dollars. I knew
that she was terrified of touching
one cent of the capital, and
lived well within the income
from good sound stocks.</p>

<hr />

<p>I took her telegram out of the
pocket of my coat which was
hanging over the back of a chair.
COME AT ONCE STOP AM IN
TERRIBLE TROUBLE ... The
only kind of terrible trouble
Matilda could be in was if some
swindler talked her out of some
of her capital! And that definitely
would not be easy to do. I
grinned to myself at the recollection
of her worrying herself
sick once over what would
happen to her if there was a
revolution and the new government
refused to honor the old
government bonds.</p>

<p>Things began to make sense.
Her telegram, then those pictures
moved around in the front
room, and the one she had forgotten
to hide, in the guest
room. If the other pictures were
anything like it, I could see how
Aunt Matilda might cash in on
part of her securities to invest
in what she thought was a sure
thing.</p>

<p>But sure things are only as
good as the people in control of
them. Many a sure thing has
been lost to the original investors
by stupid decisions leading
to bankruptcy, and many a
seemingly sure thing has fleeced
a lot of innocent victims.</p>

<p>Slowly, as I thought it out, I
became sure that that was what
had happened.</p>

<p>Then why Aunt Matilda's
about-face, hiding the pictures
and telling me to go back to
Chicago? Had she threatened
whoever was behind this, and
gotten her money back? Or had
she again become convinced that
her financial venture was sound?</p>

<p>In either case, why was she
trying to keep me from knowing
about the pictures?</p>

<p>I made up my mind. Whether
Aunt Matilda liked it or not, I
was going to stay until I got to
the bottom of things. What Aunt
Matilda evidently didn't realize
was that no inventor who really
had something would waste time
trying to find backing in a place
like Sumac.</p>

<p>Getting dressed, I decided
that first on the agenda would
be to find where Matilda had
hidden those pictures, and get a
good look at them.</p>

<p>That was simpler than I expected
it to be. When I came out
of my room I stuck my head in
the kitchen doorway and said
good morning to her, and she
leaped to her feet to get some
breakfast ready for me. It was
obvious that she was anxious to
get me fed and out of the house.</p>

<p>Then I simply took the two
steps past the bathroom door to
the door to her bedroom and
went in. The pictures were
stacked against the side of her
dresser. The one of the church
was the first one. It was on its
side.</p>

<p>With a silent whistle of
amazement I bent down to
watch it. The car was not parked
at the curb in it, but there
were several children walking
along, obviously on their way to
school. And they were walking.
Moving.</p>

<hr />

<p>I picked up the picture. It was
as heavy as it should be, but not
more. A faint whisper of sound
seemed to come from it. I put
my ear closer and heard children's
voices. I explored with my
ear close to the surface, and
found that the voices were loudest
when my ear was closest to
the one talking, as though the
voices came out of the picture
directly from the images!</p>

<p>All it needed to be perfect was
a volume control somewhere. I
searched, and found it behind
the upper right corner of the
picture. I twisted it very slowly,
and the voices became louder. I
turned it back to the position it
had been in.</p>

<p>The next picture was of the
railroad depot. The telegrapher
and baggage clerk were going
around the side of the depot towards
the tracks. A freight
train was rushing through the
picture.</p>

<p>Even as I watched it in the
picture, I heard the wail of a
train whistle in the distance,
and it was coming from outside,
across town. That freight train
was going through town <i>right
now</i>.</p>

<p>I put the pictures back the
way they had been, and stole
softly from Aunt Matilda's bedroom
to the bathroom, and
closed the door.</p>

<p>"No wonder Aunt Matilda invested
in this thing!" I said to
my image in the mirror as I
shaved.</p>

<p>Picture TV would make all
other TV receivers obsolete!
Full color TV at that! And with
some new principle in stereophonic
sound!</p>

<p>What about the fact that
neither picture had been plugged
into an outlet? Probably run by
batteries.</p>

<p>What about the lack of
weight? Obviously a new TV
principle was involved. Maybe it
required fewer circuits and less
power.</p>

<p>What about the broadcasting
end, the cameras? Permanently
set up? What about the broadcast
channels?</p>

<p>There had been ten or twelve
pictures. I'd only looked at two.
Was each a different scene?
Twelve different broadcasting
stations in Sumac?</p>

<p>It had me dizzy. Probably the
new TV principle was so simple
that all that could be taken care
of without millions of dollars
worth of equipment.</p>

<p>A new respect for Aunt Matilda
grew in me. She had
latched on to a money maker! It
didn't hurt to know that I was
her favorite nephew, either.
With my Ph.D. in physics, and
my aunt as one of the stockholders,
I could probably land a
good job with the company.
What a deal!</p>

<p>By the time I finished shaving
I was whistling. I was still
whistling when I went into the
kitchen for breakfast.</p>

<p>"You'll have to hurry, Arthur,"
Aunt Matilda said. "Your
train leaves in forty-five minutes."</p>

<p>"I'm not leaving," I said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>I went over to the bright
breakfast nook and sat down,
and took a cautious sip of coffee.
I grunted my approval of it
and looked around toward Aunt
Matilda, smiling.</p>

<p>She was staring at me with
wide eyes. She looked as haggard
as though she had just
heard she had a week to live.</p>

<p>"But you must go!" she croaked
as though my not going were
unthinkable.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you old fox," I
said. "I know a good thing as
well as you do. I want to get a
job with that outfit."</p>

<p>She came toward me with a
wild expression on her face.</p>

<p>"Get out!" she screamed. "Get
out of my house! I won't have
it! You catch that train and get
out of town. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Matilda!" I protested.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the end I had to get out
or she would have had a stroke.
She was shaking like a leaf, her
skin mottled and her eyes wild,
as I went down the front steps
with my bag.</p>

<p>"You get that train, do you
hear?" was the last thing she
screamed at me as I hurried toward
Main Street.</p>

<p>However, I had no intention
of leaving town with Aunt Matilda
upset that way. I'd let her
have time to cool off, then come
back. Meanwhile I'd try to get
to the bottom of things. A thing
as big as wall TV in full color
and stereophonic sound must be
the talk of the town. I'd find out
where they had their office and
go talk with them. A career with
something like that would be the
best thing I could ever hope to
find. And getting in on the
ground floor!</p>

<p>It surprised me that Aunt Matilda
could be so insanely greedy.
I shook my head in wonder. It
didn't figure.</p>

<p>I had breakfast at the hotel
cafe and made a point of telling
the waitress, who knew me, that
it was my second breakfast, and
that I had intended to catch the
morning train back to Chicago,
but maybe I wouldn't.</p>

<p>After I finished eating I asked
if it would be okay to leave
my suitcase behind the counter
while I looked around a bit. She
showed me where to put it so it
would be out of the way.</p>

<p>When I paid for my breakfast
I half turned away, then turned
back casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," I said.
"Where's this wall TV place?"</p>

<p>"This what?" she said.</p>

<p>"You know," I said. "Color TV
like a picture you hang on a
wall."</p>

<p>All the color faded from her
face. Her eyes went past me,
staring. I turned in the direction
she was staring, and on the wall
above the plateglass front of the
cafe was a picture.</p>

<p>That is, there was a picture
frame and a pair of dark glasses
that took up most of the picture,
with the lower part of a forehead
and the upper part of a
nose. I had noticed it once while
I was eating and had assumed
it was a display ad for sun
glasses. Now I looked at it more
closely, but could detect no
movement in it. It still looked
like an ad for sun glasses.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're
talking about," I heard the
waitress say, her voice edged
with fear.</p>

<p>"Huh?" I said, turning my
head back to look at her. "Oh.
Well, never mind."</p>

<p>I left the cafe with every outward
appearance of casual innocence;
but inside I was beginning
to realize for the first time
the possibilities and the danger
that could lie in the use of this
new TV development.</p>

<p>That had been a Big-Brother-is-Watching-you
setup back
there in the cafe, except that it
had been a girl instead of a man,
judging from the style of sun
glasses and the smoothness of
the nose and forehead.</p>

<p>I had wondered about the
broadcasting end of things. Now
I knew. That had been the TV
"eye," and somewhere there was
a framed picture hanging on the
wall, bringing in everything that
took place in the cafe, including
everything that was said. Everything
<i>I</i> had said, too. It was an
ominous feeling.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda had almost had
a stroke trying to get me out
of town. Now I knew why. She
was caught in this thing and
wanted to save me. Four days
ago she had probably not fully
realized the potentiality for evil
of the invention, but by the
time I showed up she knew it.</p>

<p>Well, she was right. This was
not something for me to tackle.
I would keep up my appearance
of not suspecting anything, and
catch that train Aunt Matilda
wanted me to catch.</p>

<hr />

<p>From way out in the country
came the whistle of the approaching
milk run, the train
that would take me back to Chicago.
In Chicago I would go to
the F.B.I, and tell them the
whole thing. They wouldn't believe
me, of course, but they
would investigate. If the thing
hadn't spread any farther than
Sumac it would be a simple matter
to stop it.</p>

<p>I'd hurry back to the cafe and
get my suitcase and tell the
waitress I'd decided to catch the
train after all.</p>

<p>I turned around.</p>

<p>Only I didn't turn around.</p>

<p>That's as nearly as I can describe
it. I did turn around. I
know I did. But the town turned
around with me, and the sun and
the clouds and the countryside.
So maybe I only thought I
turned around.</p>

<p>When I tried to stop walking
it was different. I simply could
not stop walking. Nothing was
in control of my mind. It was
more like stepping on the brakes
and the brakes not responding.</p>

<p>I gave up trying, more curious
about what was happening than
alarmed. I walked two blocks
along Main Street. Ahead of me
I saw a sign. It was the only
new sign I had seen in Sumac.
In ornate Neon script it said,
"PORTRAITS by Lana."</p>

<hr />

<p>I don't know whether my feet
took me inside independently of
my mind or not, because I was
sure that this was the place and
I wanted to go in anyway.</p>

<p>Not much had been done to
modernize the interior of the
shop. I remembered that the last
time I had been here it had been
a stamp collector headquarters
run by Mr. Mason and his wife.
The counter was still there, but
instead of stamp displays it held
a variety of standard portraits
such as you can see in any portrait
studio. None of the TV
portraits were on display here.</p>

<p>The same bell that used to
tinkle when I came into the
stamp store tinkled in back of
the partition when I came in. A
moment later the curtain in the
doorway of the partition parted,
and a girl came out.</p>

<p>How can I describe her? In
appearance she was anyone of a
thousand smartly dressed brunettes
that wait on you in
quality photograph studios, and
yet she wasn't. She was as much
above that in cut as the average
smartly dressed girl is above a
female alcoholic after a ten-day
drunk. She was perfect. Too perfect.
She was the type of girl a
man would dream of meeting
some day, but if he ever did he
would run like hell because he
could never hope to live up to
such perfection.</p>

<p>"You have come to have your
portrait taken?" she asked. "I
am Lana."</p>

<p>"I thought you already had
my portrait," I said. "Didn't you
get it from that eye in the hotel
cafe?"</p>

<p>"It's not the same thing,"
Lana said. "Through an eye you
remain a variable in the Mantram
complex. It takes the
camera to fix you, so that you
are an iconic invariant in the
Mantram." She smiled and half
turned toward the curtain she
had come through. "Would you
step this way, please?" she invited.</p>

<p>"How much will it cost?" I
said, not moving.</p>

<p>"Nothing, of course!" Lana
said. "Terrestrial money is of
no use to me since you have
nothing I would care to buy.
And don't be alarmed. No harm
will come to you, or anyone
else." A fleeting expression of
concern came over her. "I realize
that many of the people of
Sumac are quite alarmed, but
that is to be expected of a people
uneducated enough to still
be superstitious."</p>

<p>I went past her through the
curtain. Behind the partition I
expected to see out-of-this-world
scientific equipment stacked to
the ceiling. Instead, there was
only a portrait camera on a tripod.
It had a long bellows and
would take a plate the same size
as that picture of the church I
had seen.</p>

<p>"You see?" Lana said. "It's
just a camera." She smiled disarmingly.</p>

<hr />

<p>I went toward it casually, and
suddenly I stopped as though another
mind controlled my actions.
When I gave up the idea
I had had of smashing the
camera, the control vanished.</p>

<p>There was no lens in the lens
frame. "Where's the lens?" I
said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't use a glass lens,"
Lana said. "When I take the picture
a lens forms just long
enough to focus the elements of
your body into a Mantram fix."
She touched my shoulder.
"Would you sit down over there,
please?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a
Mantram fix?" I asked her.</p>

<p>She paused by the camera and
smiled at me. "I use your language,"
she said. "In some of
your legends you have the notion
of a Mantram, or what you
consider magical spell. In one
aspect the notion is of magical
words that can manipulate natural
forces directly. The notion
of a devil doll is a little closer.
Only instead of actual substance
from the subject&mdash;hair, fingernail
parings, and so on&mdash;the
Mantram matrix takes the detailed
force pattern of the subject,
through the lens when it
forms. So, in your concepts,
what results is an iconic Mantram.
But it operates both ways.
You'll see what I mean by that."</p>

<p>With another placating smile
she stepped behind the camera
and without warning light seemed
to explode from the very air
around me, without any source.
For a brief second I seemed to
see&mdash;not a glittering lens&mdash;but
a black bottomless hole form in
the metal circle at the front of
the camera. And&mdash;an experience
I am familiar with now&mdash;I seemed
to rush into the bottomless
darkness of that hole and back
again, at the rate of thousands
of times a second, arriving at
some formless destination and
each time feeling it take on more
of form.</p>

<p>"There. That wasn't so bad,
was it?" Lana said.</p>

<p>I felt strangely detached, as
though I were in two places at
the same time. I told her so.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it," she
assured me. "In fact, you will
get to enjoy it. <i>I</i> do. Especially
when I've made several prints."</p>

<p>"Why are you doing this?" I
asked. "Who are you? <i>What</i> are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm a photographer!" Lana
said. "I'm connected with the
natural history museum of the
planet I live on. I go to various
places and take pictures, and
they go into exhibits for the
people to watch."</p>

<p>She pulled the curtain aside
for me to leave.</p>

<p>"You're going to let me
leave? Just like that?" I said.</p>

<p>"Of course." She smiled
again. "You're free to go
wherever you wish, to your
aunt's or back to Chicago. I was
glad to get your portrait. In return,
I'll send you one of the
prints. And would you like one
of your aunt's? Actually, when
she came in to have her picture
taken it was for the purpose of
sending it to you. She was my
first customer. I've taken a special
liking to her and given her
several pictures."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I would like
one of Aunt Matilda."</p>

<p>When I emerged from the
shop I discovered to my surprise
that the train was just
pulling into the depot. An urge
to get far away from Sumac possessed
me. I trotted to the cafe
to get my bag, and when the
train pulled out I was on it.</p>

<hr />

<p>There's little more to tell. In
Chicago once again, I spent a
most exasperating two days trying
to inform the F.B.I., the police,
or anyone who would listen
to me. My fingers couldn't dial
the correct phone number, and
at the crucial moment each time
I grew tongue-tied. My last attempt
was a letter to the F.B.I.,
which I couldn't remember to
mail, and when I finally did remember
I couldn't find it.</p>

<p>Then the express package
from Sumac came. With fingers
that visibly trembled I took out
the two framed pictures, one of
Aunt Matilda in the process of
dusting the front room. All of
her pictures that she had hidden
from me were back in their
places on the walls. While I
watched her move about, she
went into the sewing room, and
there I saw a picture on the wall
that looked familiar.</p>

<p>It was of me, an opened express
package at my feet, a
framed picture held in my
hands, and I was staring at it
intently.</p>

<p>In the picture I was holding,
Aunt Matilda looked in my direction
and waved, smiling in
the prim way she smiles when
she is contented. I understood.
She had me with her now.</p>

<p>I laid the picture down carefully,
and took the second one
out of the box.</p>

<p>It was not a picture at all, it
was a mirror!</p>

<p>It couldn't be anything except
a mirror. And yet, suddenly, I
realized it wasn't. The uncanny
feeling came over me that I had
transposed into the mirror and
was looking out at myself. Even
as I got that feeling I shifted
and was outside the mirror looking
at my image.</p>

<p>I found that I could be in
either place by a sort of mental
shift, something like staring at
one of the geometrical optical
illusions you can find in any psychology
textbook in the chapter
on illusions, and seeing it become
something else.</p>

<p>It was strange at first, then
it became fun, and now, as I
write this, it is a normal thing.
My portrait is where it should
be&mdash;on the medicine cabinet in
the bathroom, where the mirror
used to be.</p>

<p>But I can transpose to any of
the copies of my portrait, anywhere.
To Aunt Matilda's sewing
room, or to the museum, or to
Lana's private collection. The
only thing is, it's almost impossible
to tell when I shift, or
where I shift to. It just seems to
happen.</p>

<p>The reason for that is that
my surroundings, no matter in
what direction I look, are
exactly identical with my real
surroundings. My physical surroundings
are duplicated exactly
in all my portraits, just as Aunt
Matilda's are in the portrait of
her that hangs on my study wall.
She is the invariant of each of
her iconic Mantrams and her
surroundings are the variables
that enter and leave the screen.
I am the invariant in my own
portraits, wherever they are. So,
except for the slight <i>twist</i> in my
mind that takes place when I
<i>shift</i>, that I have learned to
recognize from practice in front
of my "mirror" each morning
when I shave, and except for the
portrait of Aunt Matilda, I
would never be able to suspect
what happens.</p>

<p>If Lana had taken my picture
without my knowing it and I
had never seen one of her collection
of portraits, nor ever
heard of an iconic Mantram, I
would have absolutely nothing to
go on to suspect the truth that I
know. Except for one thing.</p>

<p>I don't quite know how to explain
it, except that I must actually
transfer to one of my
portraits, and, transferring, I
am more real than&mdash;what shall
I call it?&mdash;the photographic reproduction
of my real surroundings.
Then, sometimes, the
photographic reproduction, the
iconic illusion, that is my environment
when I am <i>in</i> one of
the portraits of me, fades just
enough so that I can look "out"
into the reality where my portrait
hangs, and see, and even
hear the <i>watchers</i>, as ghosts in
my solid "reality."</p>

<hr />

<p>Quite often I can only hear
them, and then they are voices
out of nowhere, sometimes addressing
me directly, just as
often talking to one another and
ignoring my <i>presence</i>. But when
I can see them too, they appear
as ghostly but sharply clear visions
that seem to be present
in my solid-looking environment.
There, but somewhat transparent.</p>

<p>I have often seen and talked
to Lana in this manner, in her
far-off world, where I am part
of her private collection. In fact,
I can almost always tell when I
<i>shift</i> to my portrait in her gallery,
because I am suddenly
exhilarated and remain so until
I shift back, or to some other
portrait. That is so even when
she is not there but out on one
of her many photographic expeditions.</p>

<p>When she is there, and is
watching me, and my thoughts
are quiet and my mind receptive,
she becomes visible. A
ghost in my study, or the lab
where I work, or&mdash;if I am
asleep&mdash;in my dreams. Like an
angel, or a goddess. And we
talk.</p>

<hr />

<p>Back in the physical reality,
of course, no one else can hear
her voice. My real body is going
through its routine work almost
automatically but my mind, my
consciousness, is focused into my
portrait in Lana's gallery, and
we are talking. And of course in
the real world I am talking too,
but my associates can't see who
I'm talking to, and it would be
useless to try to explain to them.</p>

<p>So I'm getting quite a reputation
as a nut! Can you imagine
that?</p>

<p>But why should I mind? My
reality has a much broader and
more complex scope than the
limited reality of my associates.
I might be fired, or even sent to
a state hospital, except for the
fact that Lana foresees such
problems and teaches me enough
things in my field that are unknown
to Earth, so that my employers
consider me too valuable
to lose.</p>

<p>If this story were fiction the
ending would have to be that I
am in love with Lana and she
with me, and there would be a
nice conclusive ending where she
comes back to Earth to marry
me and carry me back to her
world, where we would live happily
ever after. But the truth of
the matter is that I'm not in
love with Lana, nor she with me.
Sometimes I think I am her favorite
portrait, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>But really, everything is so
interesting. Lana's gallery
where I hang, the museum
where there are new faces each
time I look out, and new voices
when I can't see out, Aunt Matilda's
sewing room where she
is at the moment, and all Sumac
as she goes about her normal
pattern of living.</p>

<p>It is a rich, full life that I
live, shifting here and there in
consciousness while my physical
body goes about its necessary
tasks, as often unguided as not.
(What a reputation I'm getting
for absent-mindedness, too!)</p>

<p>And out of it all has come a
perspective that, when I feel it
strongly, makes me feel almost
like a god. In that perspective
all my portraits (and there are
many now, on many worlds and
in many places on this world!)
blend into one. That one is the
stage of my life. But not a stage,
really. A show window. Yes, that
is it. A show window, where the
<i>watchers</i> pass.</p>

<p>I live in a show window that
opens out in many worlds and
many places that are hidden
from me by a veil that sometimes
grows thin, so I can see
through it. And from the other
side of that veil, even when I
cannot see through it, come the
voices of the watchers, as they
pass by, or pause to look at me.</p>

<p>And I am not the only one!
There are others. More and
more of them, as Lana comes
back on her photographic expeditions
for the museum.</p>

<p>None that I have met understand
what it is about as fully
as I do. Some have an insight
into the true state of things, but
very very few.</p>

<p>But that is understandable.
Lana can't give the same time
to them that she gives to me.
There aren't that many hours in
a day! And, you see, I am her
favorite.</p>

<p>If I were not, she would never
have permitted me to tell you all
this, so I must be her favorite!</p>

<p>Doesn't that make sense?</p>

<p>I <i>AM</i> her favorite!</p>
